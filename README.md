## Overview

I created a multi step form in this project. There are five steps in this form.

1. Your Info
2. Select Plan
3. Addons
4. Summary

Your Info: This consists of couple of input bar quite easy. I used grid here and there to structure the way it was asked.

Select Plan: This is where I needed to create a toggle button which was a lot of fun. I changed the toggle button a little bit. That iss intentional. I thought it was a better idea.

Addons: There are some checkbox here. Nothing too fancy. Other than the goback and next-step button which all other steps have that i forgot to mention earlier

Summary: All the choices will be shown here. If wanted user can change the selected plan here or confirm the selection. Upon confirming thank you page will be shown.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox {I rarely use flexbox. I prefer using grid}
- CSS Grid
- computer-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I am proud of these:

1. Learning react
2. learning react router
3. The toggle button. Although I did this myself and it was quite easy.

### Continued development

I will continue to add javascript in the summary and addons and as well as in app.jsx file. There are few works that are left to do. I will also add the css for the mobile version of this multi step form.
